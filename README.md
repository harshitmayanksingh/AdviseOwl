💡 Inspiration
AdviseOwl was inspired by real problems faced by students: lack of clarity in course mapping, difficulty finding relevant mentors, and overwhelming curriculum guides. We interviewed over 50 students across departments to understand their pain points and validated the core need for a smart, adaptive academic advisor.

🧪 Use Cases
A first-year student wants to explore multiple majors before deciding.

A CS major seeks a course sequence optimized for AI career paths.

A transfer student needs help mapping old credits to a new university system.

Any student looking for a peer or senior mentor based on interests.
